# pixel-perfect-object-based-collision
This is the pixel-perfect object-based collision tutorial code for GameMaker (as of IDE v2023.1.1.62).

- Open "PPOBC tutorial code.txt"
- Copy and paste the code into the "Step" event of the object you want collisions for (as in the player), or copy/paste the code into a script if desired.
- Change "oWall" to the wall object that you will be using (if necessary)
- If the collision mask of the calling instance (as in the player) differs from the sprite itself, change "sprite_index" to "mask_index". (Use Ctrl+F to find and replace)
- Open "collision_real_id.txt"
- In your project, create a script (name it whatever you want), delete all code (including "function"), and copy/paste the code from "collision_real_id.txt" into the script

(Optional)
- Open "collision_real.txt"
- In your project, create a script (name it whatever you want), delete all code (including "function"), and copy/paste the code from "collision_real.txt" into the script

Done!
