# pixel-perfect-object-based-collision
This is the pixel-perfect object-based collision tutorial code for GameMaker (as of IDE v2023.1.1.62)

- Open the .txt file
- Copy and paste the code into the "Step" event of the object you want collisions for (as in the player), or copy the code into a script if desired.
- Change "oWall" to the wall object that you will be using (if necessary)
- Done!
